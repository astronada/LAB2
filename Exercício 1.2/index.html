            <p> CrossFit is a fitness regimen developed by Greg Glassman over several decades. CrossFit is constantly varied functional movements performed at high intensity. All CrossFit workouts are based on functional movements, and these movements reflect the best aspects of gymnastics, weightlifting, running, rowing and more. These are the core movements of life. They move the largest loads the longest distances, so they are ideal for maximizing the amount of work done in the shortest time. Intensity is essential for results and is measurable as work divided by time or power. The more work you do in less time, or the higher the power output, the more intense the effort. By employing a constantly varied approach to training, functional movements and intensity lead to dramatic gains in fitness.</p>



            <p>The community that spontaneously arises when people do these workouts together is a key component of why CrossFit is so effective, and it gave birth to a global network of CrossFit affiliates that number over 13,000. Harnessing the natural camaraderie, competition and fun of sport or game yields an intensity that cannot be matched by other means.</p>

            <p>While CrossFit challenges the world's fittest, the program is designed for universal scalability, making it the perfect application for any committed individual, regardless of experience. We scale load and intensity; we don't change the program. The needs of Olympic athletes and our grandparents differ by degree, not kind.</p>

            <h3>Join a Local Affiliate</h3>

            <hr>

            <p>It must be understood that CrossFit.com workouts are extremely demanding and will tax the capacities of even the world's best athletes. You would be well advised to take on the WOD cautiously and move toward completing the workouts comfortably and consistently before throwing yourself at them 100 percent. The best results have come for those who have scaled the workouts down to establish competency before maximizing intensity. Workouts can be scaledÑor modifiedÑby adjusting the length, number of reps, loads, distances or even movements. Properly implemented scaling preserves the intent of the original workout while taking into account the unique needs of the athlete.</p>

            <p>The workouts on CrossFit.com represent one presentation of the CrossFit philosophy of constantly varied functional movements performed at high intensity. You'll see a mixture of gymnastics, strength training and conditioning, all presented in variety of formats. Some workouts are longer than others, and some will contain more or less elements. The overall goal is to ensure athletes are exposed to a broad array of movements, loads and time domains.</p>
